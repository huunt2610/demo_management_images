# FlaskUpload_withPWD
A simple flask upload program for multiple files requiring credentials



## For code used in the Medium article, look at :

- upload_app.py
- templates/upload.html
- config.py



Now we have a database, we can run the app with 
```
python upload_app.py
```

and the uploaded files should appear in a directory named `uploads_folder`
